GalaxyGoo's Cell Project
===============

This project, the Clay Cell activity, was developed as a hands-on learning activity to help students learn about the parts of the cell. 

Students build 3-d models of cells, organelle by organelle, with colorful modeling clay. Once the clay dries, the cells are sliced and the resulting cross-sections are examined.
