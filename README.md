GalaxyGoo
=========

GalaxyGoo was science, art, and discovery. Our primary mission was to increase science literacy. The resources we developed were free to teachers, students, and the general public.

We brought together scientists, teachers, programmers, web developers, artists, and writers to collaborate on the development of educational software and curriculum materials.
