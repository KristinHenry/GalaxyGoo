GalaxyGoo
=========

GalaxyGoo is science, art, and discovery. Our primary mission is to increase science literacy. The resources we develop are free to teachers, students, and the general public.

We bring together scientists, teachers, programmers, web developers, artists, and writers to collaborate on the development of educational software and curriculum materials.
